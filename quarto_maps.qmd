With the [leaflet package](https://r-graph-gallery.com/package/leaflet.html), it is easy to include an interactive map into a quarto document.

```{r package_load, message=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(here, leaflet)
here::i_am("images_in_R_plots.qmd")
```

# First map

This example is taken from their [documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/articles/leaflet.html).

```{r}
#| column: screen
#| out-width: 100%

# Load the library.
library(leaflet)

# Make a map
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>% # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng = 174.768, lat = -36.852, popup = "The birthplace of R")
```

Here is an alternative way to achieve the same thing, without using pipes in the code: 

```{r}
m <- leaflet()
m <- addTiles(m)
m <- addMarkers(m, lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
m
```


# Let's find SLU on the map

```{r}
library(leaflet)
m <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()
m  # a map with the default OSM tile layer
```

```{r}
m %>% fitBounds(0, 62, 1, 15)
```
