With the [leaflet package](https://r-graph-gallery.com/package/leaflet.html), it is relatively easy to include an interactive map into a quarto document. 

```{r package_load, message=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(here, leaflet)
here::i_am("images_in_R_plots.qmd")
```

# First map

This example is taken from their [documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/articles/leaflet.html).


```{r}
m <- leaflet()
m <- addTiles(m)
m <- addMarkers(m, lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
m
```


# Let's find SLU on the map

First we render a map of the entire world.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
m <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()
m  # a map with the default OSM tile layer
```

Then we hone in on Sweden. The coordinates here are in the format `(longitude east, latitude south, longitude west, latitude north)`. 

```{r}
m %>% fitBounds(15, 55, 17, 70)
```

Let's find Uppsala - rough coordinates taken from the web, the rest is try-and-error. I am sure there is a better way to do this. 

```{r}
m %>% fitBounds(17.6, 59.78, 17.67, 59.9)
```

And once we have found the campus we can add a marker. 

```{r}
m %>% fitBounds(17.6542, 59.812, 17.6543, 59.819)
m %>% addMarkers(m, lng=17.6543, lat=59.816, popup="SLU campus
")
```
